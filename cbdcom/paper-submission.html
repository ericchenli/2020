Selected papers will be recommended to prestigious journal special issues, among the others: Symmetry @ MDPI (SCIE), IEEE Access (SCIE), ACM Transactions on Internet Technology (SCIE).

Some papers originally submitted as full papers can be accepted as short papers or posters during the review process.

At least one of the authors of any accepted paper is requested to register and present the paper at the conference.
